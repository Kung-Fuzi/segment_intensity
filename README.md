# segment_intensity
Segment and quantify cell edge intensities from IHC data

1. Cell segmentation by thresholded local minima seeded watershed. Code derived from EpiTools for Napari (https://github.com/epitools/epitools).
2. Quantify cell edge intensity by average intensity per pixel on cell perimenters.
